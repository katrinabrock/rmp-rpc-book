# Introduction

The first part of this book does not contain any code. It explains some basics
about the library we'll build, and the tools we'll use.

- [chapter 1.1](ch01-01-messagepack-rpc.md) explains what MessagePack-RPC is and what kind of problems is solves
- [chapter 1.2](ch01-02-tokio.md) gives an overview of the Tokio stack

To make it easier to follow and to skip chapters, all the code is also
available on github, in the [rmp-rpc-demo repository](https://github.com/little-dude/rmp-rpc-demo).
There is a branch per chapter.
